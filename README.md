# Attendance-Agent-

1. Abstract

Attendance Agent is a Java-based console system developed to simplify manual attendance tracking. Traditional paper-based methods are slow and error-prone. This project automates the process by allowing users to add students, mark attendance, and view records. Git and GitHub were used for version control. The system improves accuracy, reduces paperwork, and offers a simple, structured solution for basic attendance management.

2. Introduction

Attendance monitoring is essential in schools and workplaces. Manual registers may get misplaced and often contain errors. With growing digital needs, an automated system becomes necessary. This project introduces a basic Java program that records and displays attendance using a user-friendly menu. The application is lightweight, easy to run, and suitable for learning environments.

3. Objective

Develop an automated attendance system using Java.

Reduce human errors in attendance marking.

Maintain organized, easily accessible records.

Provide a simple menu-driven console interface.

Use Git and GitHub for version control and hosting.

4. Methodology
4.1 Architecture

Input: User adds students and marks attendance.

Processing: Java methods store and manage data using ArrayList.

Output: Attendance displayed through console menus.

4.2 Tools

Java (JDK 17/21), VS Code, Git, GitHub, Windows OS.

4.3 Implementation

Created Java files: Main.java, AttendanceRecord.java, AttendanceAgent.java.

Added logic for adding/viewing attendance.

Compiled using javac Main.java and executed using java Main.

Project uploaded to GitHub using git init, git add, git commit, and push commands.

4.4 Program Flow

Launch → Menu → Choose option → System processes → Display result → Repeat.

5. Results and Discussion

The system successfully allows adding students, marking attendance, and viewing records. The GitHub upload was completed. Compared to manual methods, the system offers faster updates, fewer errors, and better organization.
Limitations: Data is not saved permanently, and no GUI or report export feature exists.

6. Conclusion

The Attendance Agent project shows how a simple Java-based system can automate attendance effectively. It improves accuracy and reduces manual effort. Using Git and GitHub enhanced version control skills. Future improvements can include file storage, database support, GUI, and report generation.
